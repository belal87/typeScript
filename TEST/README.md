# Typescript MERN

hello
<---------- TypeScript Documentation ------------->

# What is TypeScript?

In a simple words, Types + JavaScript = TypeScript
It is a superset of JS
developed and maintained by Microsoft
we can use type of check data type

# Why TypeScript?

JS Check types in run time while typescript add static typing to JS so we can handle errors before running the program.
increase readability and code quality
popular JS library Angular use TypeScript.
It can be used in both: client and server side.
Intellisense IDE Support while coding: code completion, content assist and code hinting

# Install and use typescript

# How does it work?

index.ts -> tsc index.ts -> index.js

# Built-in data types

built in types: number, string, boolean, void, null, undefined, any etc.
user-defined types: Arrays, Enums, Classes, interfaces etc.

# User-defined data types

# Array Type- similar data

# Tuple Type - Mixed data type

# Enum Type: no duplicate data, helps to store constants

numeric enum, string enum, Heterogeneous enum

# any Type:

# object Type: can store value as key value pair

# custom Type: how to create custom type

# class basics and objects

class can have constructor, properties, methods

# Inheritance

# Abstract class

# Encapsulation and access modifiers:

Access modifiers: public, private, protected, readonly

# module export & import

# tsconfig and file structure

# dom manipulation

# function signature

# interface as types

# class implementing interface

# Narrowing Types

# Generics basics
